          <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.</p>
          <p>The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.</p>
          <p>These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.</p>
